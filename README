REAMDME FOR CONNECT FOUR SERVER & CLIENT

To run server:
./server <port_number>
port numbers 15000 or higher should work well

To run client:
./client <address> <port_number>
Choose the portnumber used in the server.
If both server and client are running on the same machine,
    then address is "localhost"

If client is a different machine as the server,
    get the local address of the server.
    this can be found on linux machines with with the command "ip addr show".
    copy the number to the left of the word "inet" (e.g. 192.168.1.252).
    use this as the address.
